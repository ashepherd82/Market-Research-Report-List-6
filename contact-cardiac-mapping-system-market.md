<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Contact Cardiac Mapping System Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Electroanatomical mapping</li><li>Basket catheter mapping</li><li>Traditional endocardial catheter mapping</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Contact cardiac mapping systems are used in electrophysiology procedures to map the heart's electrical activity. There are three main types of mapping systems: electroanatomical mapping, which creates a 3D map of the heart's electrical system; basket catheter mapping, which uses a catheter with multiple electrodes to map the heart's electrical signals; and traditional endocardial catheter mapping, which involves placing a catheter inside the heart to record electrical activity. Each type of mapping system has its own advantages and is used in different clinical scenarios.</p></p>
