<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Flat Panel Detector Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Indirect Conversion FPDs</li><li>Direct Conversion FPDs</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The flat panel detector (FPD) market is primarily categorized into two types: indirect conversion FPDs and direct conversion FPDs. Indirect conversion FPDs use a two-step process where X-rays are first converted into visible light, which is then detected and transformed into an electronic signal. In contrast, direct conversion FPDs convert X-rays directly into electrical charges, resulting in higher image quality and efficiency. Both types are widely used in medical imaging and industrial applications, enhancing detection and diagnostic capabilities.</p></p>
