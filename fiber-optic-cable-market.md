<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Fiber-optic Cable Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-Mode</li><li>Multi-Mode</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The fiber-optic cable market is primarily divided into two types: single-mode and multi-mode cables. Single-mode fibers use a small core diameter, allowing only one mode of light to propagate, making them ideal for long-distance communication due to lower attenuation and higher bandwidth. In contrast, multi-mode fibers have a larger core, supporting multiple light modes, which enables high data rates over shorter distances, typically within buildings or campuses. Each type serves distinct applications based on distance and bandwidth requirements.</p></p>
