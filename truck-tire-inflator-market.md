<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Truck Tire Inflator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>12V</li><li>120V</li><li>Rechargeable</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The truck tire inflator market features three primary types: 12V, 120V, and rechargeable inflators. 12V inflators connect directly to a vehicle's power outlet, offering convenience for on-the-go inflation. In contrast, 120V inflators require a standard household outlet, providing high power for larger tires but limiting portability. Rechargeable inflators combine convenience and versatility, as they operate independently of an external power source and can be charged beforehand, making them ideal for emergency situations or remote locations.</p></p>
