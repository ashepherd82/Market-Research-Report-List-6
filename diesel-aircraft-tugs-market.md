<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Diesel Aircraft Tugs Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conventional Tractors</li><li>Towbarless Tractors</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Diesel Aircraft Tugs market encompasses two primary types: Conventional Tractors and Towbarless Tractors. Conventional Tractors utilize a towbar to connect with an aircraft, providing stability and control during movement on the tarmac. In contrast, Towbarless Tractors offer a more efficient design, allowing direct coupling to the aircraftâ€™s landing gear for smoother maneuverability without a towbar. Both types cater to the needs of airports and ground handling services, enhancing operational efficiency and safety in aircraft movements.</p></p>
