<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Dental Flowable Composite Materials Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Opaque</li><li>Translucent</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Dental flowable composite materials come in two main types: opaque and translucent. Opaque materials have a higher level of opacity, making them ideal for covering discolorations or metal surfaces. They provide a more natural-looking finish and can be matched closely to the shade of the surrounding teeth. On the other hand, translucent materials allow some light to pass through, giving them a more natural appearance. They are commonly used for restorations in areas where esthetics are a priority, such as the front teeth.</p></p>
