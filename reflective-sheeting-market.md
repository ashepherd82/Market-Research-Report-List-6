<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Reflective Sheeting Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Glass Bead Type</li><li>Micro Prismatic Type</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The reflective sheeting market primarily consists of two main types: glass bead type and micro prismatic type. Glass bead reflective sheeting uses spherical glass beads to enhance visibility, primarily in road signs and markings. In contrast, micro prismatic sheeting employs a series of tiny prisms that provide superior retro-reflectivity, making it ideal for applications requiring high visibility in low-light conditions, such as traffic signs and vehicle markings. Both types enhance safety by improving visibility at night or in adverse weather.</p></p>
