<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absorbable Cardiac Stent Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Polymer</li><li>Bomaterials</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The absorbable cardiac stent market includes two main types: polymer and biomaterials. Polymer stents are made from biocompatible materials that gradually dissolve in the body over time, providing temporary support to the affected artery. On the other hand, biomaterial stents are made from natural materials like collagen or silk that also break down in the body but offer the advantage of potentially being more biologically compatible. Both types of stents aim to improve patient outcomes by reducing the risk of long-term complications associated with traditional metal stents.</p></p>
