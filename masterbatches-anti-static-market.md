<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Masterbatches Anti-Static Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Migratory Antistats</li><li>Non-Migratory Antistats</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The masterbatches anti-static market is primarily divided into two types: migratory and non-migratory antistats. Migratory antistats are additives that gradually move to the surface of the plastic, providing temporary anti-static properties, which may diminish over time. In contrast, non-migratory antistats are incorporated into the polymer matrix, offering long-lasting anti-static effects without leaching out. Each type serves different applications and performance requirements, influencing industries like packaging, electronics, and automotive by enhancing product safety and functionality.</p></p>
