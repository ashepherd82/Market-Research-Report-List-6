<p><h1>Non-foldable Intraocular Lens Market Size 2024 - 2031 Global Industrial Analysis, Market Share, Top Key Players, Product Types and Forecast Research Report</h1></p><p><strong>Non-foldable Intraocular Lens Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Non-foldable intraocular lenses (IOLs) are rigid lenses used primarily in cataract surgery to replace the eye's natural lens after it has been removed. Unlike foldable lenses, which can be inserted through smaller incisions due to their flexible nature, non-foldable IOLs require larger incisions, limiting their usability in certain surgical techniques. These lenses are typically made from acrylic or PMMA materials and are known for their durability and stability within the eye.</p><p>The Non-foldable Intraocular Lens Market is experiencing significant growth due to an increasing aging population and rising prevalence of cataracts globally. Enhanced awareness about advanced eye care and improvements in healthcare infrastructure also contribute to market expansion. Furthermore, the demand for surgical procedures with favorable outcomes has led to technological advancements, increasing the adoption of non-foldable IOLs.</p><p>Recent trends indicate a shift towards innovative lens designs and improved surgical techniques, as well as a focus on personalized treatment options. The Non-foldable Intraocular Lens Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 10.9% during the forecast period, reflecting a robust outlook driven by evolving patient needs and advancements in ophthalmic care.</p></p>
