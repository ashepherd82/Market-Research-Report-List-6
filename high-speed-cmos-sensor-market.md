<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The High Speed CMOS Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Front-illuminated (FI) CMOS</li><li>Backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>High Speed CMOS Sensor Market consists of two main types: Front-illuminated (FI) CMOS sensors and Backside-illuminated (BSI) CMOS sensors. FI CMOS sensors have the photodiodes positioned in front of the transistor layer, providing good sensitivity and dynamic range. BSI CMOS sensors have the photodiodes placed at the back of the sensor, allowing more light to reach them, resulting in better low-light performance. Both types are essential in applications requiring high-speed image capture, such as scientific imaging, surveillance, and automotive safety systems.</p></p>
