<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Agricultural Pumps Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal pumps</li><li>Displacement pumps</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The agricultural pumps market primarily consists of two types: centrifugal pumps and displacement pumps. Centrifugal pumps use rotational energy to move fluids, making them ideal for irrigation and drainage applications due to their efficiency and ability to handle large volumes of water. Displacement pumps, on the other hand, function by mechanically moving water through a chamber, making them suitable for high-pressure applications and precise flow control. Both types play crucial roles in enhancing agricultural productivity and resource management.</p></p>
