<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Denatured Ethanol Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Completely Denatured</li><li>Special Denatured</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The denatured ethanol market is primarily divided into two types: Completely Denatured Ethanol (CDE) and Special Denatured Ethanol (SDE). CDE is rendered unfit for human consumption by adding substances like methanol or isopropanol, making it suitable for industrial applications, such as solvents or fuel. SDE, on the other hand, uses specific denaturants to tailor ethanol for particular uses, such as personal care products or food processing, while still being unsuitable for drinking. Both types serve critical roles in various industries.</p></p>
